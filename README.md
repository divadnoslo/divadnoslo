- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David Olson (@divadnoslo). I have a formal electrical engineering education, a BS in ELectrical Engineering from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, 
     and an MS in Electrical Engineering with a focus in Systems and Controls. 
     I like to work on simple maker projects in my spare time and apply my STEM knowledge to pursuits beyond academic and business.
     
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Python as I break my dependancy from MATLAB. I have been building all my projects for use on the Raspberry Pi 4, 
      which allows me to interface with sensors and hardware to build cool projects!
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the process of building an automated laser pointer to annoy my wife! I have a two-axis servo motor system which points a laser beam, 
      put together by parts that I 3D printed. I am using OpenCV to detect faces, which will serve as a target for my laser pointer. 
      (Don't worry, I'll add an offset so I don't blind my wife)
